# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was created as a part of the prework required for the course. Using the guides provided, I created the page to store all of my notes for CSS, HTML, GIT and Javascript. It was an excellent way of learning the basics of each language, while also  creating something I will use throughout the entirety of thr course. So far, the notes on the webpage are solely an outline of each language, but as the course progresses, I am to develop it further, to store more complex and detailed descriptions of the four.

## Usage

The usage of this website is quite simple. Each section contains a short description of the languages I learned during the website's development. Opening the DevTools console, you can see Javascript running behind the scenes. The code was designed to select one language at random for you to study first.
